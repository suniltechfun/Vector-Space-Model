      "daniel burley woolfall daniel burley woolfall 15 june 1852 24 october 1918 was the 2nd president of fifa an english fa administrator from blackburn woolfall was elected as president on 4 june 1906 a key aim during his presidency was to achieve uniform football rules on an international level and he played a prominent role in the drafting of fifas new constitution under woolfall the application of the laws of the game established under the english model became compulsory and a clear definition was made of international matches two years after assuming the presidency he helped to organise the first noteworthy international football competition the 1908 olympic games in london his tenure as president brought the arrival of fifas first noneuropean members in south africa argentina chile and the united states but was interrupted by the outbreak of the first world war woolfalls presidency ended with his death in october 1918 virginia state route 27 state route 27 sr 27 is a freeway in arlington county virginia in the united states it was built during world war ii to connect the pentagon with us route 50 us 50 and northern arlington to the west and washington dc to the east its route parallels the southern boundaries of arlington national cemetery at its southernmost point route 27 passes through a complex interchange with interstate 395 i395 shirley highway called the mixing bowl although local motorists more recently use that term also to refer to the springfield interchange on the capital beltway in springfield it is an important commuter route as well as providing access to a number of military installations the cemetery and national memorials because route 27 is the closest road to the site of the september 11 attack on the pentagon the route has been designated the 911 heroes memorial highway route 27 begins at an interchange with us 50 it then has an interchange with 2nd street south which serves as an entrance to fort myer the next interchange with route 244 offers a very short merge area because of the proximity to the exit ramps to i395 and arlington ridge road the mixing bowl is the first interchange in northern virginia with a three level bridgeramp from i395 to westbound route 27 on the lowest level eastbound route 27 to mixing bowl in the middle and southbound i395 on top in 1970 this was followed by a second three level stackjoyce street south on the lowest level eastbound route 27 on the middle bridge and i395 on the top level at this point route 27 becomes a part of the collector lanes and ramps of the mixing bowl until its second interchange with route 244 also coincident with the second route 244 interchange route 27 is the northern terminus of the reversible high occupancy vehicle lanes of i395 the westbound entrance to these lanes have a series of manually closed barriers to prevent an accidental oncoming collision during the hours each day when traffic flows to the east on the hov lanes the final interchange in virginia accesses route 110 the pentagon north parking lot and boundary channel drive although the ramp from eastbound route 27 to northbound route 110 is open to the public it is on the pentagon reservation and is patrolled by the pentagon police the route ends at the boundary channel which is the border with the district of columbia route 27 is closed for large events held at the pentagon including the annual marine corps marathon and the army tenmiler a number of points of interest are visible from the highway including from west to east fort myer which was the site of the first military test flight henderson hall the headquarters of the united states marine corps the united states air force memorial the pentagon the navy annex the pentagon memorial the pentagon city mall and arlington national cemetery the road was constructed as a part of the pentagon road network during world war ii to provide access to the newly constructed war department headquarters buildings the system included three cloverleaf interchanges which were among the earliest such structures constructed in the united states those roads were transferred to the virginia department of highways on december 17 1964 and assigned the number route 27 however at that time the mixing bowl included a ramp from the westbound shirley highway to the eastbound route 27 when the highoccupancy vehicle lanes were added to i395 in the 1970s the mixing bowl was reconfigured so that the route 27 lanes were separated as collector lanes from the through lanes of i395 because the collector lanes were built on the site of the ramp from westbound shirley highway to the eastbound route 27 the ramp was replaced with a ramp from the eastbound route 27 into the pentagon south parking lot the mixing bowl is the first interchange in northern virginia with a three level bridgeramp from i395 to westbound route 27 on the lowest level eastbound route 27 to mixing bowl in the middle and southbound i395 on top in 1970 this was followed by a second threelevel stackjoyce street south on the lowest level eastbound route 27 on the middle bridge and i395 on the top level route 27 is near the site of the september 11 attacks on the pentagon many commuters and drivers on the road witnessed the hijacked american airlines flight 77 fly directly over route 27 and crash into the pentagon witnesses included daryl donley and steve riskus both of whom took some of the first photographs after the plane crashed as the plane passed over route 27 it clipped several light poles one light pole landed on the windshield of a taxicab driven by lloyd england the section northeast of i395 was closed for several weeks following the attack as a security measure when it reopened no stopping signs were placed along the section of route 27 near the pentagon to increase security the cloverleaf interchange between route 27 and columbia pike was reconfigured by eliminating the separate loop ramp from eastbound route 27 to westbound columbia pike the ramp from westbound columbia pike to eastbound route 27 was relocated parallel to route 27 and the resulting freed area was used to construct a security checkpoint leading to a new pentagon loading dock a driveway from the checkpoint runs parallel to route 27 separated by a high metal fence however the pentagon memorial still remains visible behind this fence north of the memorial a high cement retaining wall and berm has been constructed to protect the pentagon from any possible explosion threats on route 27 these and related security improvements cost 35 million equivalent to in and were completed in october 2004 on september 11 2010 the portion of route 27 near the crash site was dedicated as 911 heroes memorial highway after receiving that designation by the state legislature commemorative signs have been added on both sides of the highway in 2001 planning began for a replacement of the us 50 bridge over route 27 which had been built in 1944 by the war department construction of a replacement bridge began in october 2005 and ended in august 2007 the project cost 65 million equivalent to in at 340 am on december 22 2004 a gasoline tank truck overturned and exploded on washington boulevard at the mixing bowl near the pentagon the accident killed the driver and sparked initial concerns that this explosion was another terrorist attack the driver was headed to a nearby gas station near the pentagon the bridge over columbia pike west of the mixing bowl has been rated as poor and a new replacement bridge has been proposed with a reconfiguration of the interchange if funds are available construction is expected to begin in 2012 and completed in 2015 karl prusik dr karl prusik born 19 may 1896 in vienna d 8

a 1957 alabama college face the experience and difficulties of ethnic strife and integration the expression heart of dixie is a nickname for the state of alabama the fictional randolph university is based on auburn university alabama heart of dixie was poorly received by many critics rita kempley staff writer at the washington post panned the film writing ally sheedy virginia madsen and phoebe cates combine their negligible talents in heart of dixie a melodrama so full of hams it oinks led by sheedy the tedious trio plays giddy coeds caught up in the racist and sexist traditions of the south in the late 50s they all sound like theyve been gulping hush puppy batterworking from mccowns histrionic screenplay martin davidson of eddie and the cruisers proves once again that he dont know nothing bout directing no movies contrasting this opinion notable film critic vincent canby of the new york times wrote heart of dixie is a cleareyed funny and affecting movie about the emotional awakening of a pretty white alabama coed in 1957 on the eve of the great racial struggles that would mark the 1960s throughout the southmr mccowns screenplay based on the novel heartbreak hotel by anne rivers siddons is refreshing in the way that it refuses to impose a long historical view on the immediate events it is recording the movie is always aware of history but it somehow avoids the awful selfassurance that comes with 2020 hindsightmiss sheedy is so good as maggie that the characters liberation and the rise of her social consciousness appear to be genuine triumphs miss madsen who looks a little like carole landis as well as like kim novak is also fine as are mr williams phoebe cates as maggies unconventional friend and don michael paul who manages to play maggies southern

fdration internationale de football association serving from 1954 to 1955 he was actively involved in the official associations of belgium sports born in 1876 in dsseldorf germany rw seeldrayers studied law at the universit libre de bruxelles free university of brussels where he began his sporting activities at 19 he was one of the founders of the union royale belge des socits de football association urbsfa or royal belgian union of the football association societies for which he was the treasurer for four years and a member of the executive counsel for 25 years he was later elected as a member of honour in 1914 the union used his talents as an orator and named him a delegate to fifa of which he was made vicepresident in 1927 in 1899 seeldrayers began a career as a sports journalist with the magazine la vie sportive sporting life writing a column under the pen name spectator ten years later he founded the national committee for physical education which merged with the belgian olympic committee he became head of the committee beginning in 1946 succeeding prince albert de ligne in 1920 he was technical secretary of the olympic games at anvers and member of the appeals jury for football at the olympics several times he was most notable in this role at the 1936 summer olympics in berlin when during the peru vs austria game spectators invaded the pitch which provoked an appeals jury consultation the austrian football association sent a complaint to the appeals committee which decided after deliberation to replay the match behind closed doors peru disagreed and their entire olympic squad left the games complaining of the crafty berlin decision he also received the official czechoslovak complaint following the abandoned 1920 olympic final which had been refereed by john lewis an inveterate founder of clubs and associations the following organizations are to seeldrayers credit the waterloo golfclub 1923 the ixelles football club which would be part of the merger with the racing club of brussels and the anglobelgian cricket sporting club selldrayers seemed to be well received in english circles uptodate and to the point in matters of sport he spoke the english language at the same time seeldrayers continued his journalistic activities and began a new collaboration with the publication sports echo lcho des sports he ended this aspect of his activities in 1935 while still continuing to publish articles and making his opinions known in the columns of the bulletins of the international olympic committee world war ii slowed down his activities without stopping them as a member of the belgian olympic committee during the occupation he stood up for the independence of belgian sport at the end of the war he was one of the members of the international olympic committee for the first postwar games in 1946 a great mutual respect existed between seeldrayers and the then president of fifa universally respected frenchman jules rimet this translated on the part of the belgian into a motion introduced on july 25 1946 at a fifa congress to change the name of the world cup to the jules rimet cup for many years the question of amateurism posed a problem with the economic development of sports the phenomenon of professionalism began to bring into question the fundamentals of the conception of the olympic games as p de coubertin wanted them to be debates raged and a commission on amateurism was created supported by the international olympic committee which seeldrayers took part in in the end the commission submitted its final report in 1947 at the session in stockholm it included a definition of amateurism and required future participants in the olympic games to sign a declaration affirming that they were true amateurs and proposed the creation of a permanent commission this was composed of three members of the international olympic committee and a delegate of each international federation at the beginning of 1955 jules rimet resigned from fifa and passed his authority to his vicepresident r w seeldrayers this handing down of power as well as the matches of the world cup of 1954 were shown on television for the first time under his presidency the federation counted 85 members and celebrated its fiftieth anniversary under his presidency of fifa seeldrayers faced another problem fifa was reproached for having given permission for false amateurs to participate in a helsinki tournament even though a definition of amateurism had been introduced in the fifa bylaws by seeldrayers himself vice president of the federation at the time the problem was complex with the decision of which games will participate in majors sports events at stake it was also a time when regimes used sports as a means of propaganda aware of the importance of this problem seeldrayers remained faithful to his view of the sport for him from a point of view strictly olympic sport is only possible theoretically when practiced by amateurs his opinion didnt prevent him from respecting professional players who followed the spirit of the game with loyalty sincerity and fairplay and even though he clearly saw the use of sports in communist propaganda he understood and approved that phenomenon to a certain extent in his opinion sports were a key element of social organization they must be integrated into the school curriculum on the same level that any other subject and are capital to youths education seeldrayers considered the criticisms flawed and over time his opinion didnt improve he believed that it was the duty of the press to teach the spectator rw seeldrayers died a year after his election as president of fifa on october 7 1955 due to illness and received a semiofficial funeral following a governmental decision he was posthumously elected as a member of the ioc international olympic committee it was then decided that this title would not be given posthumously again seeldrayers was a very accomplished sportsman evidenced by the many sports in which he competed he had a preference for team sports this agreed with his conception of sports since according to seeldrayers sports must be the playing field of an apprenticeship in the necessary values of life and community eight fields of belgian sports benefited from seeldrayers attentions athletics football aviation cricket field hockey golf and in a small measure tennis and swimming athletics and football being his main focus he was the belgian 110 metre hurdles champion in 1897 and he competed as a hurdler for ten years he was the belgium division of honour champion with the racingclub of brussels team in 1900 and captain of the university team of brussels in 1898 and 1899 all in all he competed for 26 years as for other fields their practice lasted an average of ten years and always at an elevated level of accomplishment winning at least a championship he had five years in the regatta club cercle des rgates of brussels and the sunburn team coup de soleil ten years of cricket in le racing and the anglobelgian club of brussels and was three times champion of belgium he was captain in 1924 of the national team which defeated france in paris for ten years he played hockey for the racingclub of brussels and in 1903 for the national team against france in paris he played golf from 1919 onwards in the waterloo golf club where he was captain for ten years jos gonzlezlander jose gonzalezlander november 13 1933 january 18 2000 was a caracas venezuela born engineer credited for leading the planning design and construction of the caracas metro during an uninterrupted period of more than thirty years from 1966 to 1997 mr gonzalezlander dedicated his life to public service rising through the ranks of the ministry of public works where he started as an assistant engineer when he was in his freshman year in engineering school he graduated in 1958 with a degree in civil engineering from universidad central de venezuela in caracas his graduation was delayed almost two years due to student unrest during the final years of general marcos prez jimnez dictatorship the venezuelan government granted him a scholarship to attend graduate school at the massachusetts institute of technology where he concentrated in transportation engineering and economics on his return to venezuela mr gonzalezlander was put in charge of the ministry of public works office of transportation planning where he spearheaded the design of the backbone of the future caracas metro system a 20 km underground double track rail line connecting the east and west ends of the city this effort would expand for 10 years before the project could muster enough public support for its construction caracas rapid growth as a result of the oil boom of the 1970s strained the capacity of the citys road network and the need for a rapid transit system became evident as automotive traffic along its modern expressways became chaotic the government of president carlos andrs prez decided to provide full political and financial support to the construction of this complex project the man selected to head this effort was jose gonzalezlander who in 1977 founded the compaa annima metro de caracas an independent government enterprise that would plan and execute the construction of the system and would operate it once completed similar to an american transit authority this was one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects undertaken in the country since the guri dam was started in the 1960s construction of the first phase was very successful and revenue service started on january 3 1983 the success of the project was in large measure attributed to mr gonzalezlander and his teams technical and managerial skills in a country where most public endeavors are stifled by poor management and charges of corruption the caracas metro and mr gonzalezlander became an example to follow during his 20 years at the helm of the company gonzalez lander oversaw the construction of the first line and of two branches see list of caracas metro stations the last rail line completed under his management was opened to revenue service in 1994 the success of the company continued during the operation of the system with the creation of a network of feeder buses which replicated the efficiency of the underground service and gained the praise of all its users this became the only centrally controlled network of high capacity buses in the city where up to that point surface transportation was provided by driverowned jitneys during his tenure the company also laid the foundation for the future growth of the system establishing an expansion program for the year 2010 that included two additional metro corridors and two extensions of existing lines three of these projects started construction between the years 2001 and 2003 gonzalezlander received multiple decorations during his professional career most notably the orden francisco de miranda and orden libertador from the venezuelan government the ordre national de la lgion dhonneur from the french government and the ordine al merito della repubblica italiana from the italian government in his honor the building that houses the operations control center and metros training facilities was named jose gonzalez lander gonzalezlander was also an accomplished amateur painter during a period of 18 years he painted several hundred oil canvases mostly depicting urban scenes of early twentieth century caracas and many portraits of his family mr gonzalezlander retired in 1997 and received the honorary title of president emeritus of the company he founded he died in caracas on january 18 2000 at the age of 66 ide devon ide is a

all of pingali nagendra raos plays were reprinted recently in a book titled pingaleeyam last night 1998 film last night is a 1998 canadian apocalyptic black comedydrama film directed by don mckellar and starring mckellar sandra oh and callum keith rennie mckellar wrote the screenplay inspired by the french film project 2000 seen by to depict different countries perspectives on the imminent turn of the millennium and opted to make the story about the end of the world the film was made and released when many were concerned about the year 2000 problem it was filmed and set in toronto the film was released to positive reviews for mckellars direction and ohs acting it won awards at the cannes and toronto international film festivals and three genie awards including best actress for oh in toronto a group of friends and family prepare for the end of the world expected at midnight as the result of a calamity that is not explained but which has been expected for several months there has been panic and rioting after the imminent catastrophe was announced but the chaos has since largely died down with only sporadic murders and robberies on the last evening depressed widower patrick meets with his family including his sister jennifer for a mock christmas dinner and celebration though he leaves prematurely to spend his final hours alone in his apartment he unexpectedly meets sandra who is stranded in the city and attempting to reunite with her new husband duncan who works at a power company duncan spends much of the day calling his customers to reassure them that their heating gas will be kept on until the very end sandra and duncan have a suicide pact although intending to die alone patrick invites sandra up to his apartment and attempts to help her find her husband meanwhile patricks best friend craig embarks on a nearly nonstop sex marathon as he attempts to fulfill every fantasy he has ever had pursuing interracial sex sex with his old french teacher mme carlton and sex with a virgin among others with sandra in need of a car and craig having a car collection patrick and sandra visit him and ask for one of his vehicles craig at first refuses wanting to die with a complete collection but patrick persuades him to give one up craig also attempts to have a homosexual affair with patrick one of his fantasies but patrick indicates he is not interested in having sex with anyone on his last night duncan is randomly murdered by a rioter and craigs car sandra has borrowed is vandalized upon realizing she will not reunite with duncan sandra asks patrick to join her suicide pact as midnight approaches they both sit on the roof facing each other listening to the song guantanamera each holding a loaded pistol to the others temple however as the final seconds approach both characters are overcome with emotion and simultaneously let their pistols slip away as they slowly embrace in a kiss the world finally ends director don mckellar wrote the screenplay after being approached by the french company hout et court which was putting together a project called 2000 seen by consisting of films depicting the approaching millennium seen from the perspectives of 10 different countries fearing a story about the millennium would become dated after 2000 mckellar was inspired to make his film about the end of the world and asked his friends what they would do if they knew the end was coming basing his screenplay on their responses his script does not explain why the world is ending because he did not view that as the point of the story the film marked mckellars first attempt at directing a feature film for the c22 million budget mckellar secured the canadian broadcasting corporation as the main sponsor with hout et court providing less than half of the budget afterwards more money was raised for the part of duncan mckellar cast canadian director david cronenberg with mckellar explainging he takes his acting seriously and cronenberg typified a certain type of person for me a softspoken articulate careful character who may have a wild interior life the most sane or the most insane character in the film initially concerned about directing and acting at the same time mckellar opted to keep the direction simple aiming for a fairly austere and elegant style shortly before shooting began he learned a hollywood film called armageddon was in the works but opted to go ahead upon hearing the stories were substantially different last night was filmed on location in and near toronto between september 15 and october 19 1997 shooting primarily took place at the macdonald block and apartment buildings near the annex filmmakers used computers to depict a car being overturned last night premiered at the cannes film festival in may 1998 and was the first film played in canada perspectives at the toronto international film festival afterwards lions gate entertainment obtained distribution rights in the united states the film received positive reviews with rotten tomatoes measuring an 84 approval rating of 49 reviews roger ebert gave the film three stars noting fears of y2k were prominent when he was writing in december 1999 but last nights apocalypse paints a picture more bittersweet than violent he found moments of startling poignancy in the last twothirds of the film stephen holden of the new york times called the film a smart stiffupperlip alternative to a movie like armageddon and said mckellar and sandra oh give intense performances but expected more panic in the case of the apocalypse entertainment weekly gave the film an a calling it a surreal elegantly melancholy and yet witty ensemble story and oh a scenestealer peter howell of the toronto star commented on the many canadian cast members suggesting the film is too damn canuck for its own good and a riot scene would help outside north america critics favoured the film as the perfect antidote to us apocalyptic films with a uk critic adding only in canada can you get away with a film like this time out called the film a witty perceptive movie exceptionally well structured in 2002 readers of playback magazine voted last night the ninth greatest canadian film of alltime in 2012 oliver lyttelton of indiewire named it one of five underseen apocalypse films worth seeing writing it compared well to armageddon and deep impact 1998 for its quiet character driven approach and that it was likely the inspiration for seeking a friend for the end of the world 2012 in 2014 colin mcneil of metro news wrote last night is perhaps the most upbeat endoftheworld movie youll ever see mckellar won the award of the youth at the cannes film festival and best canadian first feature film at the 1998 toronto international film festival for last night the film also won three genie awards where mckellar was effectively competing against himself as a screenwriter of both last night and the red violin hammartun lower secondary

roberson born november 1 1981 is an american singer songwriter and actress roberson rose to fame in the late 1990s as an original member of the rb group destinys child one of the worlds bestselling girl groups of all time following her departure from the group roberson formed anjel along with former destinys child member letoya luckett after their album was shelved roberson went on hiatus and returned to houston roberson also starred in various stage plays including those jeans how to love and not my family roberson has sold over 25 million records with destinys child her work has earned her several awards and nominations including two grammy awards and three soul train music awards latavia roberson was born on november 1 1981 she is of africanamerican louisiana creole african native american and french descent in the 1980s prior to joining destinys child latavia was a child model appearing in commercials such as soft and beautifuls just for me hair care relaxer for kids when latavia was nine years old she auditioned for a girl group to become a rapper and dancer and was one of the many girls who got through she met beyonc knowles on the same day of the audition for the group and became best friends singing and dancing with other local girls in which latavia and beyonc made a video for the song one time she then met kelly rowland in elementary school after hearing her sing she told her to try out for the group which she did initially latavia was a rapper and dancer at the time and did not sing subsequently she had vocal lessons and after singing at local events latavia got her break when she entered the singing competition tv show star search with beyonc kelly rowland tamar davis also latavias cousins sisters nikki and nina taylor the group then named girls tyme were heartbroken after losing the competition beyonces father mathew knowles began to manage the group whom changed the lineup as the group was then reduced to a quartet with bestfriend beyonc rowland and beyoncs elementary school friend letoya luckett the group underwent several name changes the dolls something fresh and clich they were shortly signed to elektra records however the group were dropped by the label after plenty of training done by the manager to become prepared and ready for the music industry they were then signed by columbia records in 1997 by the name of destinys child with beyonc and kelly as the lead singers latavia and letoya performed harmony background and occasional lead in 1998 destinys child released their selftitled debut album destinys child the singles were no no no featuring wyclef jean and with me roberson can be heard rapping in the song illusions later in 1998 their song get on the bus featuring timbaland which was released as a single in europe was featured on the why do fools fall in love soundtrack the song would later service as the lead single for their second album destinys child toured as an opening act on tlcs fanmail tour

eighttimes platinum in the us the album includes four hit singles bills bills bills bug a boo say my name and jumpin jumpin roberson performed lead on two songs sweet sixteen and whered you go additionally latavia sang lead on the song cant help myself but this song was only relead on the albums houston edition in january 2000 in the midst of the success of the writings on the wall roberson and letoya luckett attempted to bring in a thirdparty mediator to work alongside their manager mathew knowles however the pair soon found themselves on the outs with knowles when the say my name video debuted in february 2000 they were replaced by two new members michelle williams and farrah franklin which led to several lawsuits with the outcome of roberson and luckett being entitled to royalty checks from the previous albums they had made with the group whilst being in destinys child with the other members latavia had appeared in artists music videos such as jagged edge roberson had also performed with destinys child in live shows and had won awards such as soul train awards she had also starred in tv roles such as smart guy and the movie beverly hills along with the other members of the group in 2001 latavia and exdestinys child group member letoya had achieved two grammys for their contribution to say my name they had also created a group called anjel with two other girls naty quinones and tiffany beaudon whom then was replaced by natasha ramos they recorded over 22 tracks but did not release an album the tracks however were leaked on the internet the band appeared in jagged edges music video where the party at remix the record company was having difficulty so the group then parted ways for solo careers in 2003 in 2005 latavia got invited to replace kandi in the group xscape but passed on the opportunity due to her priority to take care of her family at home in houston in 2007 latavia along with other destinys child past members letoya luckett and farrah franklin appeared in the tv series boulevard of broken dreams telling their side of the story about what happened during their time with destinys child in 2008 latavia was in a stage play titled those jeans it was described as a truly well written love story about a fashion designer and a high fashion photographer looking for love in all the wrong places it ran from april 18 2008 to july 12 2008 in

interviews roberson and luckett agreed to a settlement that required them to drop the part of their lawsuit that targeted their former group members though they retained the suit against mathew knowles and required both sides to stop disparaging each other in public roberson and luckett filed another suit against destinys child they claimed that the first single survivor from destinys childs 2001 album of the same name violated their previous settlement due to its lyrics which they believed referenced the ugly split with lyrics such as thought i couldnt sell without you sold nine million the lawsuit however was dropped roberson has revealed that she had suffered with an alcohol problem after destinys child to self soothe early childhood trauma this led to being arrested with a dwi

primarily by the fireworks regulations 2004 under powers delegated from the fireworks act 2003 the pyrotechnic articles safety regulations 2015 and british standards bs 7114 until 4717 and bsen 159472015 bs 7114 defines 4 categories for fireworks people under the age of 18 are not allowed to buy fireworks nor possess them in a public place this was increased from 16 in 1997 otherwise all fireworks since 1997 must comply with bs7114 and be marked accordingly and fall into one of the following three categories under bs14035 there are also now category 2 fireworks that require a longer distance of 8 metres providing potentially better effects than 5 metre fireworks but without the fallout of category 3 fireworks fireworks of louder than 120dba at 15 metres cannot be sold to the public it is not illegal for a firework to be set off at less than the minimum safely viewable distance however in the event of any injury to a spectator the firer might be liable if the distance was too short a category 3 firework will contain no more than 1 kg net explosive content in the case of cakes and fountains except for fountain cakes which can contain up to 3 kg of net explosive content the law considers a firework professional to be someone employed in a business that fires fireworks such as a firework display outlet or a stagehand in practice most stores that sell category 4 fireworks do ask for proof of training most category 4 professionals are trained under the british pyrotechnists association professional firers training scheme although equally legitimate professional competency courses recognised under current legislation are provided by some commercial organisations such as illuminate consult company directors are liable under the health and safety at work act for the safety of their employees and prosecutions have occurred in terms of transport and storage fireworks with a minor blast hazard un category 13g are distinguished from those without that hazard namely un category 14g fireworks containing more than 25 grams of flash powder will be in category 13g and many fall into category 3 legal for public sale however the cost of complying with storage regulations means that retailers may choose not to sell 13g fireworks consumers may hold any quantity of 14g fireworks for personal use for up to 21 days if this includes 13g fireworks the time limit is only three days if storing for longer periods a license is required if storing more than 5 kg nec net explosive content except for specially licensed yearround firework shops fireworks are only for sale for chinese new year and three days prior divali and three days prior from 15 october to 10 november for guy fawkes night and from 26 to 31 december for new year typically supermarkets and other general retail outlets sell fireworks in the octobernovember period and for new year but do not sell at the other periods in most areas using or buying fireworks illegally can result in a 5000 fine or imprisonment for up to 6 months fireworks must not be let off between 11pm and 7am except on chinese new year diwali and new years eve when the period is extended until 1am and on guy fawkes night when the period is extended until midnight this restriction does not apply to displays organised by local councils it is illegal to set off fireworks including sparklers in the street or public place breaking these laws can result in an onthespot fine of 90 it should also be borne in mind that the regulations are different in northern ireland where any purchase or use of fireworks requires a licence this includes personal back garden displays oil reserves oil reserves are the amount of technically and economically recoverable oil reserves may be for a well for a reservoir for a field for a nation or for the world different classifications of reserves are related to their degree of certainty the total estimated amount of oil in an oil reservoir including both producible and nonproducible oil is called oil in place however because of reservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies only a fraction of this oil can be brought to the surface and it is only this producible fraction that is considered to be reserves the ratio of reserves to the total amount of oil in a particular reservoir is called the recovery factor determining a recovery factor for a given field depends on several features of the operation including method of oil recovery used and technological developments based on data from opec at the beginning of 2013 the highest proved oil reserves including nonconventional oil deposits are in venezuela 20 of global reserves saudi arabia 18 of global reserves canada 13 of global reserves and iran 9 because the geology of the subsurface cannot be examined directly indirect techniques must be used to estimate the size and recoverability of the resource while new technologies have increased the accuracy of these techniques significant uncertainties still remain in general most early estimates of the reserves of an oil field are conservative and tend to grow with time this phenomenon is called reserves growth many oilproducing nations do not reveal their reservoir engineering field data and instead provide unaudited claims for their oil reserves the numbers disclosed by some national governments are suspected of being manipulated for political reasons all reserve estimates involve uncertainty depending on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available and the interpretation of that data the relative degree of uncertainty can be expressed by dividing reserves into two principal classificationsproven or proved and unproven or unproved unproven reserves can further be divided into two subcategoriesprobable and possibleto indicate the relative degree of uncertainty about their existence the most commonly accepted definitions of these are based on those approved by the society of petroleum engineers spe and the world petroleum council wpc in 1997 proven reserves are those reserves claimed to have a reasonable certainty normally at least 90 confidence of being recoverable under existing economic and political conditions with existing technology industry specialists refer to this as p90 that is having a 90 certainty of being produced proven reserves are also known in the industry as 1p proven reserves are further subdivided into proven developed pd and proven undeveloped pud pd reserves are reserves that can be produced with existing wells and perforations or from additional reservoirs where minimal additional investment operating expense is required pud reserves require additional capital investment eg drilling new wells to bring the oil to the surface until december 2009 1p proven reserves were the only type the us securities and exchange commission allowed oil companies to report to investors companies listed on us stock exchanges must substantiate their claims but many governments and national oil companies do not disclose verifying data to support their claims since january 2010 the sec now allows companies to also provide additional optional information declaring 2p both proven and probable and 3p proven probable possible provided the evaluation is verified by qualified third party consultants though many companies choose to use 2p and 3p estimates only for internal purposes unproven reserves are based on geological andor engineering data similar to that used in estimates of proven reserves but technical contractual or regulatory uncertainties preclude such reserves being classified as proven unproven reserves may be used internally by oil companies and government agencies for future planning purposes but are not routinely compiled they are subclassified as probable and possible probable reserves are attributed to known accumulations and claim a 50 confidence level of recovery industry specialists refer to them as p50 ie having a 50 certainty of being produced these reserves are also referred to in the industry as 2p proven plus probable possible reserves are attributed to known accumulations that have a less likely chance of being recovered than probable reserves this term is often used for reserves which are claimed to have at least a 10 certainty of being produced p10 reasons for classifying reserves as possible include varying interpretations of geology reserves not producible at commercial rates uncertainty due to reserve infill seepage from adjacent areas and projected reserves based on future recovery methods they are referred to in the industry as 3p proven plus probable plus possible in russia reserves categories a b and c1 correspond roughly to proved developed producing proved developed nonproducing and proved undeveloped respectively the designation abc1 corresponds to proved reserves the russian category c2 includes probable and possible reserves many countries maintain governmentcontrolled oil reserves for both economic and national security reasons according to the united states energy information administration approximately of oil are held in strategic reserves of which 14 billion is governmentcontrolled these reserves are generally not counted when computing a nations oil reserves a more sophisticated system of evaluating petroleum accumulations was adopted in 2007 by the society of petroleum engineers spe world petroleum council wpc american association of petroleum geologists aapg and society of petroleum evaluation engineers spee it incorporates the 1997 definitions for reserves but adds categories for contingent resources and prospective resources contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations but the applied projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies contingent resources may include for example projects for which there are no viable markets or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly assess commerciality prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development the united states geological survey uses the terms technically and economically recoverable resources when making its petroleum resource assessments technically recoverable resources represent that proportion of assessed inplace petroleum that may be recoverable using current recovery technology without regard to cost economically recoverable resources are technically recoverable petroleum for which the costs of discovery development production and transport including a return to capital can be recovered at a given market price unconventional resources exist in petroleum accumulations that are pervasive throughout a large area examples include extra heavy oil oil sand and oil shale deposits unlike conventional resources in which the petroleum is recovered through wellbores and typically requires minimal processing prior to sale unconventional resources require specialized extraction technology to produce for example steam andor solvents are used to mobilize bitumen for insitu recovery moreover the extracted petroleum may require significant processing prior to sale eg bitumen upgraders the total amount of unconventional oil resources in the world considerably exceeds the amount of conventional oil reserves but are much more difficult and expensive to develop the amount of oil in a subsurface reservoir is called oil in place oip only a fraction of this oil can be recovered from a reservoir this fraction is called the recovery factor the portion that can be recovered is considered to be a reserve the portion that is not recoverable is not included unless and until methods are implemented to produce it volumetric methods attempt to determine the amount of oil in place by using the size of the reservoir as well as the physical properties of its rocks and fluids then a recovery factor is assumed using assumptions from fields with similar characteristics oip is multiplied by the recovery factor to arrive at a reserve number current recovery factors for oil fields around the world typically range between 10 and 60 percent some are over 80 percent the wide variance is due largely to the diversity of fluid and reservoir characteristics for different deposits the method is most useful early in the life of the reservoir before significant production has occurred the materials balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates the volume of oil water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the remaining oil it assumes that as fluids from the reservoir are produced there will be a change in the reservoir pressure that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas the method requires extensive pressurevolumetemperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field it requires some production to occur typically 5 to 10 of ultimate recovery unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics the decline curve method uses production data to fit a decline curve and estimate future oil production the three most common forms of decline curves are exponential hyperbolic and harmonic it is assumed that the production will decline on a reasonably smooth curve and so allowances must be made for wells shut in and production restrictions the curve can be expressed mathematically or plotted on a graph to estimate future production it has the advantage of implicitly including all reservoir characteristics it requires a sufficient history to establish a statistically significant trend ideally when production is not curtailed by regulatory or other artificial conditions experience shows that initial estimates of the size of newly discovered oil fields are usually too low as years pass successive estimates of the ultimate recovery of fields tend to increase the term reserve growth refers to the typical increases in estimated ultimate recovery that occur as oil fields are developed and produced bbl barrel of oil it is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes which equals between 133 and 180 billions m of oil of the worlds oil reserves have been used between 1850 and the present since opec started to set production quotas on the basis of reserves levels in the 1980s many of its members have reported significant increases in their official reserves there are doubts about the reliability of these estimates which are not provided with any form of verification that meet external reporting standards the following table illustrates these rises the sudden revisions in opec reserves totaling nearly 300 bn barrels have been much debated some of it is defended partly by the shift in ownership of reserves away from international oil companies some of whom were obliged to report reserves under conservative us securities and exchange commission rules the most prominent explanation of the revisions is prompted by a change in opec rules which set production quotas partly on reserves in any event the revisions in official data had little to do with the actual discovery of new reserves total reserves in many opec countries hardly changed in the 1990s official reserves in kuwait for example were unchanged at including its share of the neutral zone from 1991 to 2002 even though the country produced more than and did not make any important new discoveries during that period the case of saudi arabia is also striking with proven reserves estimated at between 260 and in the past 18 years a variation of less than 2 while extracting approximately during this period sadad alhuseini former head of exploration and production at saudi aramco estimates of the worlds of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources though he did not specify which countries had inflated their reserves dr ali samsam bakhtiari a former senior expert of the national iranian oil company has estimated that iran iraq kuwait saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have overstated reserves by a combined 320390bn barrels and has said as for iran the usually accepted official is almost one hundred billion over any realistic assay petroleum intelligence weekly reported that official confidential kuwaiti documents estimate reserves of kuwait were only of which half were proven and half were possible the combined value of proven and possible is half of the official public estimate of proven reserves in july 2011 opecs annual statistical review showed venezuelas reserves to be larger than saudi arabias a 2008 united states geological survey estimates that areas north of the arctic circle have of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and of natural gas liquids in 25 geologically defined areas thought to have potential for petroleum this represented 13 of the expected undiscovered oil in the world of the estimated totals more than half of the undiscovered oil resources were estimated to occur in just three geologic provincesarctic alaska the amerasia basin and the east greenland rift basins more than 70 of the mean undiscovered oil resources was estimated to occur in five provinces arctic alaska amerasia basin east greenland rift basins east barents basins and west greenlandeast canada it was further estimated that approximately 84 of the oil and gas would occur offshore the usgs did not consider economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources this assessment was lower than a 2000 survey which had included lands south of the arctic circle in october 2009 the usgs updated the orinoco tar sands venezuela value to in june 2013 the us energy information administration published a global inventory of estimated recoverable tight oil and tight gas resources in shale formations technically recoverable shale oil and shale gas resources an assessment of 137 shale formations in 41 countries outside the united states the inventory is incomplete due to exclusion of tight oil and gas from sources other than shale such as sandstone or carbonates formations underlying the large oil fields located in the middle east and the caspian region off shore formations or about which there is little information estimated technically recoverable shale oil resources total 335 to 345 billion barrels energy and resources john hoagland john hoagland june 15 1947 march 16 1984 was a war photographer and

bruce mccaffrey memorial graduate student seminar series named in his honour linens linens are fabric household goods intended for daily use such as bedding tablecloths and towels linens may also refer to church linens meaning the altar cloths used in church the earliest known household linens were made from thin yarn spun from flax fibres to make linen cloth ancient egypt babylon and phoenicia all cultivated flax crops the earliest surviving fragments of linen cloth have been found in egyptian tombs and date to 4000 bce flax fibres have been found in cloth fragments in europe that date to the neolithic prehistoric age cotton is another popular fibre for making cloth used for household linens its use in clothmaking also dates back to prehistoric times in indian subcontinent china peru and egypt the indian subcontinent was especially well known for high quality cotton cloth as early as 1500 bce linen was an especially popular cloth during the middle ages in europe when cotton was an exotic import it was used for underclothing chemises shifts shirts and blouses in fact most clothing worn next to the skin by those able to afford an extra layer of clothing the tradition of calling household fabric goods linens dates from this period but meant clothing as much as large sheets according to medieval tradition which survived up until the modern era a bride would often be given a gift of linens made by the women in her family as a wedding present to help her set up her new married home in france this was called a trousseau and was often presented to the bride in a wooden hope chest the industrial revolution brought huge changes to cloth manufacturing the rise of european colonialism at the same time helped support the rapid growth of cloth production by creating many cheap sources of raw materials british cloth manufacturers would import raw cotton from america and the british west indies to ireland where it would be spun into yarn the yarn would be imported into england where mechanized factories employed thousands of workers who would weave cloth on industrial looms in 1781 a cloth producer from manchester testified about his business to a committee of the house of commons in the british parliament he stated that he employed 6000 workers who would print and stamp 60000 yards of cotton and linen fabric a year cotton gradually replaced linen for most uses in clothing but remained preferred for bedsheets and tablecloths other european countries manufactured and traded their own types of household linens as well and mass manufacturing techniques and trade competition gradually made affordable household linens common today the term linen is still used for bedsheets tablecloths and similar household textiles even though most are made of cotton synthetic fabrics or blends especially in american english they may be called white goods otherwise a term for kitchen major appliances cleaning household linens is done as appropriate to the type of cloth household linens are most likely to have stains from organic sources such as food blood and soil if the linens are made of natural fibres such as linen or cotton the cloth will need to be rinsed as soon as possible in cold water to prevent the stain from becoming permanent stains from red wine or red or purple berries and fruit are an exception and must be washed in boiling water yet despite this these stains may be impossible to remove otherwise regular washing of household linens should be done in hot water for hygienic reasons to destroy bacteria left on the linens from frequent use linen and cotton that are white may also become yellow over time but this is eliminated by bleaching either with liquid bleach or by the traditional method of hanging the linens in the sun to let the sunlight bleach out the discoloration household linens are stored near the area where they are used when possible for convenience otherwise bed and kitchen and dining linens may be stored together in a linen closet or cupboard there are many methods of folding linens for storage for formal occasions table linens may be ironed before use traditionally table linens could be starched while ironing to decrease wrinkling and retain a smooth pristine appearance seasonal storage of linens led to the development of natural pest control methods in europe to prevent moth larvae and other insects or rodents from eating the cloth sachets made of dried margosa neem cloves lavender and other herbs are traditional as are cedar wood chips industrial laundries were developed in the middle ages when large convents and monasteries used their own facilities hospitals and boarding schools followed this example today there are several types of industrial laundries hospitals often use laundry chutes to collect used linens these are transported to an industrial laundry where they are sorted into three categories regularly soiled infected or staff uniforms they are laundered as appropriate usually at high temperatures to ensure that viruses bacteria and soil are cleaned and that the linens are hygienic before being returned to the hospital in india dhobi ghats provide laundry service to both institutions and households household linens and clothing are both collected on a fixed day of the week by the dhobi who washes the laundry at a ghat which is often in a large dhobi ghat zone where many dhobis work at their own stall each stall is approximately four square metres laundry is washed in large tubs rinsed cleaned by beating on a stone made for the purpose and then the linens are hung on lines to dry industrial linens are treated in steamers for several hours for hygienic reasons dhobis also iron linens the collecting and restoring of antique linens can be complex depending u\n"
